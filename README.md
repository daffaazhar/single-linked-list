# single-linked-list
This repository contains a simple implementation of a single linked list data structure in C language. A linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position in the list. This implementation supports the basic operations of a linked list, including insertion and deletion.

This implementation uses a pointer-based approach, with each element in the list being represented as a node that contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The code is easy to understand, making it a great resource for learning about linked lists or for use in your own projects. It is also fully tested and has been verified to work correctly.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about linked lists or an experienced developer in need of a reliable implementation, this repository has everything you need to get started. Feel free to fork the repository and modify it to suit your own needs!
