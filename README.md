# single-linked-list
This repository contains a simple implementation of a single linked list data structure in C language. A linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position in the list. This implementation supports the basic operations of a linked list, including insertion and deletion.

This implementation uses a pointer-based approach, with each element in the list being represented as a node that contains a data value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The following is a description of the contents of each file:
1. `insert-start.c`: single linked list insert operation in the first part.
2. `insert-end.c`: single linked list insert operation in the last part.
3. `insert-after.c`: single linked list insert operation after specific data.
4. `insert-before.c`: single linked list insert operation before specific data.
5. `delete-start.c`: single linked list delete operation on the first data.
6. `delete-end.c`: single linked list delete operation on the last data.
7. `delete-specific.c`: single linked list delete operation on the specific data.
8. `sll-application.c`: the application of single linked list in various cases, including sequential data insertion, data search, and specific data deletion.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about linked lists or an experienced developer in need of a reliable implementation, this repository has everything you need to get started. Feel free to fork the repository and modify it to suit your own needs!
